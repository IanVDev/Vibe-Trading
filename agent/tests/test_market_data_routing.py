"""Regression tests for the Market data routing policy in the agent system prompt.

These tests pin three immutable substrings inside `_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. Removing
or altering any of them breaks the LLM-facing contract that forces market
data requests (price, OHLCV, ticker) to use ccxt/yfinance/akshare skills
first, and forbids web_search/read_url for quantitative market data.

Risk level: 3 (system prompt is an external behavioural contract).
